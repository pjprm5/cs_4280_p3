P2 Parser

Changed to C++ because of a struggle with C.
Test programs 3 and 4 are not passing at the moment, should be able to figure it out eventually.

To run program type:

make

then type:

./frontEnd filename.fs

To clean .o files type:
 
make clean

To clean the .exe file type:

make outclean

Filename must have a .fs extension to be parsed.
